I am a second-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/) with research focusing on statistical learning theory and its intersections with statistical physics and graphical models. Prior to this, I obtained BA degrees in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I was advised by [Manolis Vlatakis](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vlatakis/). 

Research Interests: Statistical Learning Theory, Spin Glasses, and Inference for Stochastic Optimization Algorithms, Monte Carlo Markov Chains.

## News 
* New [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20180) about the complexity of performative prediction now on arXiv! 
* My work with Ioannis Panageas on learning Ising models under hard-constraints was accepted in ICLR '26. See you in Rio!
* I will be visiting the Archimedes Research Unit in Athens for two months as a student researcher
