Hi! I'm a undergraduate student in [EECS at UC Berkeley](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu), where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Manolis Vlatakis](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~emvlatakis/index.html).  

My research interests broadly lie in <b> extending stochastic optimization into non-convex regines</b>. More specifically, I'm interested in <i>developing theory to understand, improve, and simplify empirical optimization methodology</i>.
